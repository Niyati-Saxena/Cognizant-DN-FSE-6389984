# Asymptotic Notation
<br> 
# Big O Notation :
-> Describes how the resource requirements grow as the input size increases.
-> Focuses on *Upper Bound* performance ie *worst case* scenario.
-> Ignores the constants and the lower-order terms.
-> Describes efficiency of the algorithm, enabling comaparions.

# Search Operations :
Therea are mainly two types of search operations
-> Linear Search - Which searches data linearly going on each elements one by one.
-> Binary Search - Which searches data by dividing the *sorted* array into two halves iteratively.

# Comparision of TC :
| Case Type    | Linear Search | Binary Search |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| Best Case    | O(1)          | O(1)           |
| Average Case | O(n)          | O(log n)       |
| Worst Case   | O(n)          | O(log n)       |


# Most Suitable Algorithm 
For our E-Commerce Platform the most suitble will be a *BINARY SEARCH* : 
-> Attributes like ProductID & ProductName can be soted easily.
